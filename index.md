R-MAPI is an RCPP software package based on the MAPI (Mapping Average Pairwise Information) package created by Piry et al [Methods in Ecology and Evolution Jul. 2016 - doi: 10.1111/2041-210X.12616 - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305424222]. It offers greater ease of use and computation speed than the original and increased functionality including:	

-An R user interface
-Options to vary the parameters used to compute map data
-Options to improve map clarity by removing “background noise”
-The built-in ability to generate artificial data to test the map-making functions

Like MAPI, R-MAPI can be used to process any spatially distributed pairwise data where some relationship between the data values and the spatial distance between the corresponding points is known or hypothesized. 

To get started, take a look at the [installation instructions](https://mrc-ide.github.io/RMAPI/articles/installation.html), followed by a [basic tutorial](https://mrc-ide.github.io/RMAPI/articles/basic-tutorial.html) on running the program.
